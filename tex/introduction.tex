\section*{Introduction}
  Since images stored on computers are simply matrices where each element
  represents a pixel, matrix methods learned in class can be used to
  modify images. The purpose of this project was to apply matrix manipulations
  on given image files, shown below as Figure~\ref{fig:p1} and
  Figure~\ref{fig:p2}.
